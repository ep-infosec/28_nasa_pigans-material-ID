For the extra curious reader who wants to generate their own txt files instead of the ones we used, you will need a few extra dependencies.

You will need to use Anaconda and install Fenics.

```python
 conda install -c conda-forge fenics
```

After that you can run the *generate_txt_data.py* file.

Be sure to have the same parameters in this file as are used in the generate_pigan_data.py file or the code will break.
